# T-c-Tac-Toe-Game
A simple terminal-based Tic Tac Toe game built with Python to practice programming and game logic.

## About
This project implements a live Tic Tac Toe game where a human player (O) plays against the computer (X).  
The game board updates in real time after each move, and the computer automatically chooses its moves using a simple function.  
It was created to practice Python programming, loops, functions, and basic AI logic, while making game development fun and interactive.

## Features
- Human player (O) vs computer (X) mode
- Real time game board updates in the terminal
- Simple AI chooses moves for the computer
- Checks for winning conditions or a draw
- Clean code structure using functions and loops

## How to Run
Run the game with Python:

```bash
python tic_tac_toe.py
